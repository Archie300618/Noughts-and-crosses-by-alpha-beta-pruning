# Noughts-and-crosses-by-alpha-beta-pruning
The Alpha-Beta Pruning approach optimizes the Minimax algorithm, allowing the AI to make optimal decisions efficiently by eliminating unnecessary calculations.
Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique for the minimax algorithm, which is commonly used in two-player games like Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree.

How Alpha-Beta Pruning Works in Noughts and Crosses
Minimax Algorithm:

The game is represented as a tree, where each node is a possible board state.
Players alternate turns (MAX for one player, MIN for the other).
The goal is to find the best move by simulating future states.
Alpha-Beta Pruning Optimization:

Alpha (α) tracks the best maximizer (X's) choice so far.
Beta (β) tracks the best minimizer (O's) choice so far.
If at any point, it is found that a move is worse than a previously examined move, the subtree is pruned (i.e., skipped).
Implementation Overview
Generate all possible moves.
Use minimax with alpha-beta pruning to evaluate board positions.
If a branch leads to a worse result than a previously checked one, prune it.
Return the best possible move.
